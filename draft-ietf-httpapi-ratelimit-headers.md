# Introduction

The widespreading of HTTP as a distributed computation protocol
requires an explicit way of communicating service status and
usage quotas.

This was partially addressed with the `Retry-After` header field
defined in {{!SEMANTICS=I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics}} to be returned in
`429 Too Many Requests` or `503 Service Unavailable` responses.

Still, there is not a standard way to communicate service quotas
so that the client can throttle its requests
and prevent 4xx or 5xx responses.


## Rate-limiting and quotas {#rate-limiting}

Servers use quota mechanisms to avoid systems overload,
to ensure an equitable distribution of computational resources
or to enforce other policies - eg. monetization.

A basic quota mechanism limits the number of acceptable
requests in a given time window, eg. 10 requests per second.

When quota is exceeded, servers usually do not serve the request
replying instead with a `4xx` HTTP status code (eg. 429 or 403)
or adopt more aggressive policies like dropping connections.

Quotas may be enforced on different basis (eg. per user, per IP, per geographic area, ..) and
at different levels. For example, an user may be allowed to issue:

- 10 requests per second;
- limited to 60 request per minute;
- limited to 1000 request per hour.

Moreover system metrics, statistics and heuristics can be used
to implement more complex policies, where
the number of acceptable request and the time window
are computed dynamically.

## Current landscape of rate-limiting headers

To help clients throttling their requests, servers may expose
the counters used to evaluate quota policies via HTTP header fields.

Those response headers may be added by HTTP intermediaries
such as API gateways and reverse proxies.

On the web we can find many different rate-limit headers, usually
containing the number of allowed requests
in a given time window, and when the window is reset.

The common choice is to return three headers containing:

- the maximum number of allowed requests in the time window;
- the number of remaining requests in the current window;
- the time remaining in the current window expressed in seconds or
  as a timestamp;


### Interoperability issues

A major interoperability issue in throttling is the lack
of standard headers, because:

- each implementation associates different semantics to the
  same header field names;
- header field names proliferates.

Client applications interfacing with different servers may thus
need to process different headers,
or the very same application interface that sits behind different
reverse proxies may reply with different throttling headers.

## This proposal

This proposal defines syntax and semantics for the following fields:

- `RateLimit-Limit`: containing the requests quota in the time window;
- `RateLimit-Remaining`: containing the remaining requests quota in the current window;
- `RateLimit-Reset`: containing the time remaining in the current window, specified in seconds.

The behavior of `RateLimit-Reset` is compatible with the `delay-seconds` notation of `Retry-After`.

The fields definition allows to describe complex policies, including the ones
using multiple and variable time windows and dynamic quotas, or implementing concurrency limits.

## Goals

The goals of this proposal are:

   1. Standardizing the names and semantic of rate-limit headers;

   2. Improve resiliency of HTTP infrastructures simplifying
      the enforcement and the adoption of rate-limit headers;

   3. Simplify API documentation avoiding expliciting
      rate-limit fields semantic in documentation.

The goals do not include:

  Authorization:
  : The rate-limit headers described here are not meant to support
    authorization or other kinds of access controls.

  Throttling scope:
  : This specification does not cover the throttling scope,
    that may be the given resource-target, its parent path or the whole
    Origin (see Section 7 of {{!RFC6454}}).

  Response status code:
  : The rate-limit headers may be returned in both
    Successful and non Successful responses.
    This specification does not cover whether non Successful
    responses count on quota usage.

  Throttling policy:
  : This specification does not mandate a specific throttling policy.
    The values published in the headers, including the window size,
    can be statically or dynamically evaluated.

  Service Level Agreement:
  : Conveyed quota hints do not imply any service guarantee.
    Server is free to throttle respectful clients under certain circumstances.


## Notational Conventions

{::boilerplate bcp14}

This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in {{!RFC5234}} and updated
by {{!RFC7405}} along with the "#rule" extension
defined in Section 5.6.1 of {{SEMANTICS}}.

The term Origin is to be interpreted as described in Section 7 of {{!RFC6454}}.

The "delay-seconds" rule is defined in Section 10.2.4 of {{SEMANTICS}}.

# Expressing rate-limit policies

## Time window {#time-window}

Rate limit policies limit the number of acceptable requests in a given time window.

A time window is expressed in seconds, using the following syntax:

    time-window = delay-seconds

Subsecond precision is not supported.

## Request quota {#request-quota}

The request-quota is a value associated to the maximum number of requests
that the server is willing to accept
from one or more clients
on a given basis (originating IP, authenticated user, geographical, ..)
during a `time-window` as defined in {{time-window}}.

The `request-quota` is expressed in `quota-units` and has the following syntax:

~~~
   request-quota = quota-units
   quota-units = 1*DIGIT
~~~

The `request-quota` SHOULD match the maximum number of acceptable requests.

The `request-quota` MAY differ from the total number of acceptable requests
when weight mechanisms, bursts, or other server policies are implemented.

If the `request-quota` does not match the maximum number of acceptable requests
the relation with that SHOULD be communicated out-of-band.

Example: A server could

- count once requests like `/books/{id}`
- count twice search requests like `/books?author=Camilleri`

so that we have the following counters

~~~ example
GET /books/123                  ; request-quota=4, remaining: 3, status=200
GET /books?author=Camilleri     ; request-quota=4, remaining: 1, status=200
GET /books?author=Eco           ; request-quota=4, remaining: 0, status=429
~~~

## Quota policy {#quota-policy}

This specification allows describing a quota policy with the following syntax:

~~~
   quota-policy = request-quota; "w" "=" time-window
                  *( OWS ";" OWS quota-comment)
   quota-comment = token "=" (token / quoted-string)
~~~

quota-policy parameters like `w` and
quota-comment tokens MUST NOT occur multiple times within the same quota-policy.

An example policy of 100 quota-units per minute.

~~~ example
   100;w=60
~~~

Two examples of providing further details via custom parameters
in `quota-comments`.

~~~ example
   100;w=60;comment="fixed window"
   12;w=1;burst=1000;policy="leaky bucket"
~~~

# Header Specifications

The following `RateLimit` response fields are defined

## RateLimit-Limit {#ratelimit-limit-header}

The `RateLimit-Limit` response field indicates
the `request-quota` associated to the client
in the current `time-window`.

If the client exceeds that limit, it MAY not be served.

The header value is

~~~
   RateLimit-Limit = expiring-limit [, 1#quota-policy ]
   expiring-limit = request-quota
~~~

The `expiring-limit` value MUST be set to the `request-quota` that is closer to reach its limit.

The `quota-policy` is defined in {{quota-policy}}, and its values are informative.

~~~ example
   RateLimit-Limit: 100
~~~

A `time-window` associated to `expiring-limit` can be communicated
via an optional `quota-policy` value, like shown in the following example

~~~ example
   RateLimit-Limit: 100, 100;w=10
~~~

If the `expiring-limit` is not associated to a `time-window`, the `time-window` MUST either be:

- inferred by the value of `RateLimit-Reset` at the moment of the reset, or
- communicated out-of-band (eg. in the documentation).

Policies using multiple quota limits MAY be returned using multiple
`quota-policy` items, like shown in the following two examples:

~~~ example
   RateLimit-Limit: 10, 10;w=1, 50;w=60, 1000;w=3600, 5000;w=86400
   RateLimit-Limit: 10, 10;w=1;burst=1000, 1000;w=3600
~~~

This header MUST NOT occur multiple times
and can be sent in a trailer section.

## RateLimit-Remaining {#ratelimit-remaining-header}

The `RateLimit-Remaining` response field indicates the remaining `quota-units` defined in {{request-quota}}
associated to the client.

The header value is

~~~
   RateLimit-Remaining = quota-units
~~~

This header MUST NOT occur multiple times
and can be sent in a trailer section.

Clients MUST NOT assume that a positive `RateLimit-Remaining` value is
a guarantee of being served.

A low `RateLimit-Remaining` value is like a yellow traffic-light: the red light
may arrive suddenly.

One example of `RateLimit-Remaining` use is below.

~~~ example
   RateLimit-Remaining: 50
~~~

## RateLimit-Reset {#ratelimit-reset-header}

The `RateLimit-Reset` response field indicates either

- the number of seconds until the quota resets.

The header value is

~~~
   RateLimit-Reset = delay-seconds
~~~

The delay-seconds format is used because:

- it does not rely on clock synchronization and is resilient to clock adjustment
  and clock skew between client and server (see Section 5.6.7 of {{SEMANTICS}});
- it mitigates the risk related to thundering herd when too many clients are serviced with the same timestamp.

This header MUST NOT occur multiple times
and can be sent in a trailer section.

An example of `RateLimit-Reset` use is below.

~~~ example
   RateLimit-Reset: 50
~~~

The client MUST NOT assume that all its `request-quota` will be restored
after the moment referenced by `RateLimit-Reset`.
The server MAY arbitrarily alter the `RateLimit-Reset` value between subsequent requests
eg. in case of resource saturation or to implement sliding window policies.

# Providing RateLimit headers {#providing-ratelimit-headers}

A server MAY use one or more `RateLimit` response fields
defined in this document to communicate its quota policies.

The returned values refers to the metrics used to evaluate if the current request
respects the quota policy and MAY not apply to subsequent requests.

Example: a successful response with the following fields

~~~ example
   RateLimit-Limit: 10
   RateLimit-Remaining: 1
   RateLimit-Reset: 7
~~~

does not guarantee that the next request will be successful. Server metrics may be subject to other
conditions like the one shown in the example from {{request-quota}}.

A server MAY return `RateLimit` response fields independently
of the response status code.  This includes throttled responses.

If a response contains both the `Retry-After` and the `RateLimit-Reset` fields,
the value of `RateLimit-Reset` SHOULD reference the same point in time as
`Retry-After`.

When using a policy involving more than one `time-window`,
the server MUST reply with the `RateLimit` headers related to the window
with the lower `RateLimit-Remaining` values.

Under certain conditions, a server MAY artificially lower `RateLimit` field values between subsequent requests,
eg. to respond to Denial of Service attacks or in case of resource saturation.

Servers usually establish whether the request is in-quota before creating a
response, so the RateLimit field values should be already available in that
moment.
Nonetheless servers MAY decide to send the `RateLimit` fields
in a trailer section.

# Intermediaries {#intermediaries}

This section documents the considerations advised in
Section 16.3.3 of {{SEMANTICS}}.

An intermediary that is not part of the originating service infrastructure
and is not aware of the quota-policy semantic used by the Origin Server
SHOULD NOT alter the RateLimit fields' values
in such a way as to communicate a more permissive quota-policy;
this includes removing the RateLimit fields.

An intermediary MAY alter the RateLimit fields 
in such a way as to communicate a more restrictive quota-policy when:

- it is aware of the quota-unit semantic used by the Origin Server;
- it implements this specification and enforces a quota-policy which
  is more restrictive than the one conveyed in the fields.

An intermediary
SHOULD forward a request even when presuming that it
might not be serviced;
the service returning the RateLimit fields is the sole responsible
of enforcing the communicated quota-policy,
and it is always free to service incoming requests.

This specification does not mandate any behavior on intermediaries
respect to retries,
nor requires that intermediaries have any role in respecting quota-policies.
For example, it is legitimate for a proxy to retransmit a request
without notifying the client, and thus consuming quota-units.

# Caching


As is the ordinary case for HTTP caching ({{?RFC7234}}), a response with
RateLimit fields might be cached and re-used for subsequent requests.
A cached RateLimit response, does not modify quota counters but could contain stale information.
Clients interested in determining the freshness of the RateLimit fields could rely on fields such as `Date` and on the `window` value of a `quota-policy`.

# Receiving RateLimit headers

A client MUST process the received `RateLimit` headers.

A client MUST validate the values received in the `RateLimit` headers before using them
and check if there are significant discrepancies
with the expected ones.
This includes a `RateLimit-Reset` moment too far in the future or a `request-quota` too high.

Malformed `RateLimit` headers MAY be ignored.

A client SHOULD NOT exceed the `quota-units` expressed in `RateLimit-Remaining` before the `time-window` expressed
in `RateLimit-Reset`.

A client MAY still probe the server if the `RateLimit-Reset` is considered too high.

The value of `RateLimit-Reset` is generated at response time:
a client aware of a significant network latency MAY behave accordingly
and use other informations (eg. the `Date` response header, or otherwise gathered metrics) to better
estimate the `RateLimit-Reset` moment intended by the server.

The `quota-policy` values and comments provided in `RateLimit-Limit` are informative
and MAY be ignored.

If a response contains both the `RateLimit-Reset` and `Retry-After` fields,
the `Retry-After` header field MUST take precedence and
the `RateLimit-Reset` field MAY be ignored.

# Examples

## Unparameterized responses

### Throttling informations in responses

The client exhausted its request-quota for the next 50 seconds.
The `time-window` is communicated out-of-band or inferred by the header values.

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: application/json
RateLimit-Limit: 100
Ratelimit-Remaining: 0
Ratelimit-Reset: 50

{"hello": "world"}
~~~

### Use in conjunction with custom headers {#use-with-custom-headers}

The server uses two custom headers,
namely `acme-RateLimit-DayLimit` and `acme-RateLimit-HourLimit`
to expose the following policy:

- 5000 daily quota-units;
- 1000 hourly quota-units.

The client consumed 4900 quota-units in the first 14 hours.

Despite the next hourly limit of 1000 quota-units, the closest limit
to reach is the daily one.

The server then exposes the `RateLimit-*` headers to
inform the client that:

- it has only 100 quota-units left;
- the window will reset in 10 hours.

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: application/json
acme-RateLimit-DayLimit: 5000
acme-RateLimit-HourLimit: 1000
RateLimit-Limit: 5000
RateLimit-Remaining: 100
RateLimit-Reset: 36000

{"hello": "world"}
~~~


### Use for limiting concurrency {#use-for-limiting-concurrency}

Throttling headers may be used to limit concurrency,
advertising limits that are lower than the usual ones
in case of saturation, thus increasing availability.

The server adopted a basic policy of 100 quota-units
per minute,
and in case of resource exhaustion adapts the returned values
reducing both `RateLimit-Limit` and `RateLimit-Remaining`.

After 2 seconds the client consumed 40 quota-units

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: application/json
RateLimit-Limit: 100
RateLimit-Remaining: 60
RateLimit-Reset: 58

{"elapsed": 2, "issued": 40}
~~~

At the subsequent request - due to resource exhaustion -
the server advertises only `RateLimit-Remaining: 20`.

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: application/json
RateLimit-Limit: 100
RateLimit-Remaining: 20
RateLimit-Reset: 56

{"elapsed": 4, "issued": 41}
~~~


### Use in throttled responses

A client exhausted its quota and the server throttles the request
sending the `Retry-After` response header field.

In this example, the values of `Retry-After` and `RateLimit-Reset` reference the same moment,
but this is not a requirement.

The `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code is just used as an example.

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Mon, 05 Aug 2019 09:27:00 GMT
Retry-After: Mon, 05 Aug 2019 09:27:05 GMT
RateLimit-Reset: 5
RateLimit-Limit: 100
Ratelimit-Remaining: 0

{
"title": "Too Many Requests",
"status": 429,
"detail": "You have exceeded your quota"
}
~~~


## Parameterized responses

### Throttling window specified via parameter

The client has 99 `quota-units` left for the next 50 seconds.
The `time-window` is communicated by the `w` parameter, so we know the throughput is 100 `quota-units` per minute.

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: application/json
RateLimit-Limit: 100, 100;w=60
Ratelimit-Remaining: 99
Ratelimit-Reset: 50

{"hello": "world"}
~~~

### Dynamic limits with parameterized windows

The policy conveyed by `RateLimit-Limit` states that
the server accepts 100 quota-units per minute.

To avoid resource exhaustion, the server artificially lowers
the actual limits returned in the throttling headers.

The  `RateLimit-Remaining` then advertises
only 9 quota-units for the next 50 seconds to slow down the client.

Note that the server could have lowered even the other
values in `RateLimit-Limit`: this specification
does not mandate any relation between the field values
contained in subsequent responses.

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: application/json
RateLimit-Limit: 10, 100;w=60
Ratelimit-Remaining: 9
Ratelimit-Reset: 50

{
  "status": 200,
  "detail": "Just slow down without waiting."
}
~~~

### Dynamic limits for pushing back and slowing down

Continuing the previous example, let's say the client waits 10 seconds and
performs a new request which, due to resource exhaustion, the server rejects
and pushes back, advertising `RateLimit-Remaining: 0` for the next 20 seconds.

The server advertises a smaller window with a lower limit to slow
down the client for the rest of its original window after the 20 seconds elapse.

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json
RateLimit-Limit: 0, 15;w=20
Ratelimit-Remaining: 0
Ratelimit-Reset: 20

{
  "status": 429,
  "detail": "Wait 20 seconds, then slow down!"
}
~~~

## Dynamic limits for pushing back with Retry-After and slow down

Alternatively, given the same context where the previous example starts, we
can convey the same information to the client via the Retry-After header, with
the advantage that the server can now specify the policy's nominal limit and
window that will apply after the reset, ie. assuming the resource exhaustion
is likely to be gone by then, so the advertised policy does not need to be
adjusted, yet we managed to stop requests for a while and slow down the rest of
the current window.

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: application/json
Retry-After: 20
RateLimit-Limit: 15, 100;w=60
Ratelimit-Remaining: 15
Ratelimit-Reset: 40

{
  "status": 429,
  "detail": "Wait 20 seconds, then slow down!"
}
~~~

Note that in this last response the client is expected to honor the
`Retry-After` header and perform no requests for the specified amount of
time, whereas the previous example would not force the client to stop
requests before the reset time is elapsed, as it would still be free to
query again the server even if it is likely to have the request rejected.

### Missing Remaining informations

The server does not expose `RateLimit-Remaining` values, but
resets the limit counter every second.

It communicates to the client the limit of 10 quota-units per second
always returning the couple `RateLimit-Limit` and `RateLimit-Reset`.

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: application/json
RateLimit-Limit: 10
Ratelimit-Reset: 1

{"first": "request"}
~~~

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: application/json
RateLimit-Limit: 10
Ratelimit-Reset: 1

{"second": "request"}
~~~

### Use with multiple windows

This is a standardized way of describing the policy
detailed in {{use-with-custom-headers}}:

- 5000 daily quota-units;
- 1000 hourly quota-units.

The client consumed 4900 quota-units in the first 14 hours.

Despite the next hourly limit of 1000 quota-units, the closest limit
to reach is the daily one.

The server then exposes the `RateLimit` headers to
inform the client that:

- it has only 100 quota-units left;
- the window will reset in 10 hours;
- the `expiring-limit` is 5000.

Request:

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example

~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
RateLimit-Limit: 5000, 1000;w=3600, 5000;w=86400
RateLimit-Remaining: 100
RateLimit-Reset: 36000

{"hello": "world"}
~~~



# Security Considerations

## Throttling does not prevent clients from issuing requests {#sec-throttling-does-not-prevent}

This specification does not prevent clients to
make over-quota requests.

Servers should always implement mechanisms
to prevent resource exhaustion.

## Information disclosure {#sec-information-disclosure}

Servers should not disclose operational capacity informations that
can be used to saturate its resources.

While this specification does not mandate whether non 2xx responses
consume quota, if 401 and 403 responses count on quota
a malicious client could probe the endpoint
to get traffic informations of another
user.

As intermediaries might retransmit requests and consume
quota-units without prior knowledge of the User Agent,
RateLimit headers might reveal the existence of an intermediary
to the User Agent.

## Remaining quota-units are not granted requests

`RateLimit-*` headers convey hints from the server
to the clients in order to avoid being throttled out.

Clients MUST NOT consider the `quota-units` returned in `RateLimit-Remaining`
as a service level agreement.

In case of resource saturation, the server MAY artificially lower the returned
values or not serve the request anyway.

## Reliability of RateLimit-Reset

Consider that `request-quota` may not be restored after the moment referenced by `RateLimit-Reset`,
and the `RateLimit-Reset` value should not be considered fixed nor constant.

Subsequent requests may return an higher `RateLimit-Reset` value to limit
concurrency or implement dynamic or adaptive throttling policies.

## Resource exhaustion {#sec-resource-exhaustion}

When returning `RateLimit-Reset` you must be aware that many throttled
clients may come back at the very moment specified.

This is true for `Retry-After` too.

For example, if the quota resets every day at `18:00:00`
and your server returns the `RateLimit-Reset` accordingly

~~~ example
   Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:00:00 GMT
   RateLimit-Reset: 36000
~~~

there's a high probability that all clients will show up at `18:00:00`.

This could be mitigated adding some jitter to the field-value.

## Denial of Service

`RateLimit` fields may assume unexpected values by chance or purpose.
For example, an excessively high `RateLimit-Remaining` value may be:

- used by a malicious intermediary to trigger a Denial of Service attack
  or consume client resources boosting its requests;
- passed by a misconfigured server;

or an high `RateLimit-Reset` value could inhibit clients to contact
the server.

Clients MUST validate the received values to mitigate those risks.

Commonly used header field names are:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`;
- `X-Rate-Limit-Limit`, `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining`, `X-Rate-Limit-Reset`.

There are variants too, where the window is specified
in the header field name, eg:

- `x-ratelimit-limit-minute`, `x-ratelimit-limit-hour`, `x-ratelimit-limit-day`
- `x-ratelimit-remaining-minute`, `x-ratelimit-remaining-hour`, `x-ratelimit-remaining-day`

Here are some interoperability issues:

- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` references different values, depending on the implementation:

   * seconds remaining to the window expiration
   * milliseconds remaining to the window expiration
   * seconds since UTC, in UNIX Timestamp
   * a datetime, either `IMF-fixdate` {{SEMANTICS}} or {{?RFC3339}}

- different headers, with the same semantic, are used by different implementers:

  * X-RateLimit-Limit and X-Rate-Limit-Limit
  * X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-Rate-Limit-Remaining
  * X-RateLimit-Reset and X-Rate-Limit-Reset

The semantic of RateLimit-Remaining depends on the windowing algorithm.
A sliding window policy for example may result in having a ratelimit-remaining
value related to the ratio between the current and the maximum throughput.
Eg.

~~~ example
RateLimit-Limit: 12, 12;w=1
RateLimit-Remaining: 6          ; using 50% of throughput, that is 6 units/s
RateLimit-Reset: 1
~~~

If this is the case, the optimal solution is to achieve

~~~ example
RateLimit-Limit: 12, 12;w=1
RateLimit-Remaining: 1          ; using 100% of throughput, that is 12 units/s
RateLimit-Reset: 1
~~~

At this point you should stop increasing your request rate.

# FAQ

1. Why defining standard headers for throttling?

   To simplify enforcement of throttling policies.

2. Can I use RateLimit-\* in throttled responses (eg with status code 429)?

   Yes, you can.

3. Are those specs tied to RFC 6585?

   No. {{?RFC6585}} defines the `429` status code and we use it just as an example of a throttled request,
   that could instead use even 403 or whatever status code.

4. Why don't pass the throttling scope as a parameter?

   After a discussion on a [similar thread](https://github.com/httpwg/http-core/pull/317#issuecomment-585868767)
   we will probably add a new "RateLimit-Scope" header to this spec.

   I'm open to suggestions: comment on [this issue](https://github.com/ioggstream/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers/issues/70)

5. Why using delay-seconds instead of a UNIX Timestamp?
   Why not using subsecond precision?

   Using delay-seconds aligns with `Retry-After`, which is returned in similar contexts,
   eg on 429 responses.

   Timestamps require a clock synchronization protocol 
   (see Section 5.6.7 of {{SEMANTICS}}).
   This may be problematic (eg. clock adjustment, clock skew, failure of hardcoded clock synchronization servers,
   IoT devices, ..).
   Moreover timestamps may not be monotonically increasing due to clock adjustment.
   See [Another NTP client failure story](https://community.ntppool.org/t/another-ntp-client-failure-story/1014/)

   We did not use subsecond precision because:

   - that is more subject to system clock correction
     like the one implemented via the adjtimex() Linux system call;
   - response-time latency may not make it worth. A brief discussion on the subject is
     on the [httpwg ml](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2019JulSep/0202.html)
   - almost all rate-limit headers implementations do not use it.

6. Why not support multiple quota remaining?

   While this might be of some value, my experience suggests that overly-complex quota implementations
   results in lower effectiveness of this policy. This spec allows the client to easily focusing on
   RateLimit-Remaining and RateLimit-Reset.

7. Shouldn't I limit concurrency instead of request rate?

   You can use this specification to limit concurrency
   at the HTTP level (see {#use-for-limiting-concurrency})
   and help clients to
   shape their requests avoiding being throttled out.

   A problematic way to limit concurrency is connection dropping,
   especially when connections are multiplexed (eg. HTTP/2)
   because this results in unserviced client requests,
   which is something we want to avoid.

   A semantic way to limit concurrency is to return 503 + Retry-After
   in case of resource saturation (eg. thrashing, connection queues too long,
   Service Level Objectives not meet, ..).
   Saturation conditions can be either dynamic or static: all this is out of
   the scope for the current document.

8. Do a positive value of `RateLimit-Remaining` imply any service guarantee for my
   future requests to be served?

   No. The returned values were used to decide whether to serve or not *the current request*
   and do not imply any guarantee that future requests will be successful.

   Instead they help to understand when future requests
   will probably be throttled. A low value for `RateLimit-Remaining`
   should be interpreted as a yellow traffic-light for either
   the number of requests issued in the `time-window`
   or the request throughput.

9. Is the quota-policy definition {{quota-policy}} too complex?

   You can always return the simplest form of the 3 headers

~~~ example
RateLimit-Limit: 100
RateLimit-Remaining: 50
RateLimit-Reset: 60
~~~

   The key runtime value is the first element of the list: `expiring-limit`, the others `quota-policy` are informative.
   So for the following header:

~~~ example
RateLimit-Limit: 100, 100;w=60;burst=1000;comment="sliding window", 5000;w=3600;burst=0;comment="fixed window"
~~~

   the key value is the one referencing the lowest limit: `100`

11. Can we use shorter names? Why don't put everything in one header?

   The most common syntax we found on the web is `X-RateLimit-*` and
   when starting this I-D [we opted for it](https://github.com/ioggstream/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers/issues/34#issuecomment-519366481)

   The basic form of those headers is easily parseable, even by
   implementors procesing responses using technologies like
   dynamic interpreter with limited syntax.

   Using a single header complicates parsing and takes
   a significantly different approach from the existing
   ones: this can limit adoption.

12. Why don't mention connections?

    Beware of the term "connection":
￼
￼   - it is just *one* possible saturation cause. Once you go that path
￼     you will expose other infrastructural details (bandwidth, CPU, .. see {{sec-information-disclosure}})
￼     and complicate client compliance;
￼   - it is an infrastructural detail defined in terms of server and network
￼     rather than the consumed service.
      This specification protects the services first,
      and then the infrastructures through client cooperation (see {{sec-throttling-does-not-prevent}}).
￼
￼   RateLimit headers enable sending *on the same connection* different limit values
￼   on each response, depending on the policy scope (eg. per-user, per-custom-key, ..)
￼
13. Can intermediaries alter RateLimit fields?

    Generally, they should not because it might result in unserviced requests.
    There are reasonable use cases for intermediaries mangling RateLimit fields though,
    e.g. when they enforce stricter quota-policies,
    or when they are an active component of the service.
    In those case we will consider them as part of the originating infrastructure.
